## Key areas and their use cases

### Data Platform

#### Business Context

CCI (Customer Communication Insights) Platform will have ingestions of enterprise-wide data
from first-party sources (like Customer communication, Web self Care, Sales/Presales discussion etc) and third-party sources, then refines and matches the data to create unified customer profiles. 

These profiles are the building blocks of insights that power customer journey analytics and orchestration. These inputs will then be fed into Product backlog as per business priority.

| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Reduced average handle time               | Text (including speech) comprises the highest proportion of unstructured data in most call-center operations, and therefore it offers the biggest potential impact. Making sense of this data requires scraping it from all available channels (including converting call-center recordings to text) and then cleaning it to remove unimportant words, punctuation, and special characters. Once the data is cleaned, companies can begin to generate meaningful insights from it | Predicted Chat intent uses ML to generate insights           |         |
| Reduced call volume                       | CCA will allow companies to conduct full, end-to-end analytics on millions of customer data points, looking at text and call flow volumes to proactively identify potential improvements. Based on that output, the company can design a solution that offers an improved customer journey | Sequential reduction of call volume                          |         |
| Improved service-to-sales conversion      | CCA virtual sales coach can accomplish that goal by assessing factors about a customer—not only existing data such as demographic and behavioral profiles and purchase history but also real-time data from a current service call—to predict the next product the customer is most likely to buy | Upsell and cross sell to customers have increased            |         |
| Omni-channel analytics                    | CCA will help contact center managers improve agent productivity. They can review incoming agent work volume and assess key performance indicators (KPIs). If there is an issue, contact center managers flag it and jump in to help their team. |                                                              |         |
| Voice analytics for call center managers  | CCA will have the ability to monitor calls in real time or review automated transcripts. With the right analytics, your voice channel operates as a digital channel with all the insight your team needs to improve customer experience. Based on this data, call center managers intervene in real time, suggest further training opportunities for agents to improve customer satisfaction, or escalate cases as needed. |                                                              |         |
| Forecasting and scheduling                | CCA Forecasts are typically based on a couple of years of historical volume data. The forecasting process can become quite complex when you factor in historical data by time increment and channel, and also try to determine the best forecasting algorithm to apply. Artificial intelligence makes forecasts more accurate, and since agent schedules are based on forecasts, the scheduling process receives some downstream benefits from AI. | Queue time for Customers have reduced by 30%. Agents aren't overwhelmed by volume and should be more satisfied with their schedules |         |
| Supervisor productivity and effectiveness | CCA forecasting and scheduling capabilities previously discussed will also reduce time-consuming supervisory tasks. More accurate forecasts will help ensure teams are adequately staffed so supervisors don't have to contend with agent burnout and apologizing for bad service levels to upset customers. |                                                              |         |
| coaching for individual agents            |                                                              |                                                              |         |
